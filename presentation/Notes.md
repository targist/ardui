Video steps:

Story intro(How did we get here?):

<!-- TODO -->

While learning Arduino (via #Elegoo tutorials) simple programs most of the time
required simple instructions:

- pinMode
- digitalWrite
- analogWrite
- delay

And The mobile seemed like a treasure of sensors (accelerometer, camera,
advanced CPUâ€¦) and can do advanced tasks (ML, signal processing) =? maybe
android + Arduino is a winner duo?

How do you program (send behavior from Android to Arduino)?

1- Serial communication: Short intro, and video mention.\
2- Protobuf: explain def and code generation process (kotlin (android), C
(arduino))\
3- Explain that android also has USB programming library, communication UART vs
using OTG cable\
4- By the way since we re using Protobuf we can communicate from other languages
(javascript)\
5- demo schema + android program + wiring\
proposed programs: Blink + RGB cycle.

!!! Make a good video description, it might make up for the video.

Add code link to github (make public), website, videos explaining concepts in
detail.
